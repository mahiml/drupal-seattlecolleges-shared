I mainly took online classes because I was supporting myself and needed to work full-time. Taking online classes also helped financially because I am an out-of-state resident and tuition is much cheaper for online courses.I was able to receive my AA through online courses. I met with my academic advisor regularly to make sure I was on the right track and I completed my AA degree online in two years. I loved the flexibility and freedom the online courses provided. I was able to work full-time and schedule my assignments, participation, and even testing around that schedule. I found great support from the teachers and other classmates. After I received my AA degree, I transferred to a four-year college, where I am now working toward receiving my teaching certificate.
