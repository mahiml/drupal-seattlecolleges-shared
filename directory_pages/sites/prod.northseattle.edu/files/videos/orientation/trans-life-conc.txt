In this segment, we tried to give you a taste of campus life. Hopefully, this introduction will help you find an activity that appeals to you. And remember, student government, sports, and clubs are all great ways to meet new people and discover something new about yourself.

We highly recommend getting involved in an extracurricular activity. It’s one sure way to get more out of your college experience.
