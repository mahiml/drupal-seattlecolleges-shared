The mission of Student Leadership and Multicultural Programs is to develop studentsâ€™ confidence and leadership skills to prepare them to thrive in a multicultural and global society.Students can work on projects with professional staff, faculty, administration and other students who come from diverse cultural, religious and ethnic backgrounds. Learn to listen and value diverse perspectives while collaborating to resolve challenging issues and creating win-win solutions.I learned that the activities I participated in outside of the classroom set me apart from my peers by providing me with resume enhancing, real world experience in such areas of teamwork, event planning and developing projects that benefit our community.Student Administrative Council (SAC), Student Fee Board, Student Cabinet, and various clubs & organizations on campus represent some of the great opportunities North offers to get involved on campus. Members of SAC, the fee board and cabinet are selected though a competitive application process each spring.
