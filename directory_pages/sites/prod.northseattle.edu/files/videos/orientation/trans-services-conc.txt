Hopefully, you learned a lot about the support services available at NSCC. These programs are designed to make you a more successful student, so be sure to take advantage of them.

In fact, I’m on my way to Advising right now. Even though I already know my major, I check in with my advisor each quarter to be sure I am on track and taking the right classes. I have learned firsthand that the support services on campus will help get me where I want to be.
