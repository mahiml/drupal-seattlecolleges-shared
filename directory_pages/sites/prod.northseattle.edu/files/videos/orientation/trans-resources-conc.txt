We hope you now feel familiar with the great resources North has to offer students. Students really enjoy studying at the Espresso Bar with classmates and a good cup of coffee. You'll also find the campus alert system to be really helpful — you'll get a text message straight to your cell phone when there is campus news you need to know about. Really convenient! North has some great resources that all students should take advantage of!
