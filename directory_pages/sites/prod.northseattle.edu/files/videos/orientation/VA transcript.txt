NSCC is committed to assisting students who have served our country. The Office of Veteran Affairs offers assistance to veterans, reservists, active duty personnel and eligible family members who are eligible to receive Veteran’s Administration educational benefits.

In the Veterans Affairs office we handle your VA educational benefits as quickly and efficiently as possible. We assist you with many other benefits as well. We can get you referrals for mental health issues, educational issues, health or auto insurance — anything related to veterans’s offairs. Come to the office and we will get you squared away.
