NSCC provides a variety of support services to promote student success. Many of the services are on the second floor of the College Center building, such as Student Success Services which includes Advising, Counseling, Disability Services and the Women’s Center. Also, on the second floor are Admission/Registration, the Office of Veteran Services and International Programs. Other services available on campus include Career Services/WorkSource, the Child Care Center and Workforce Education. In the next segment, we’ll cover these services. They won’t all apply to you. But the ones that do just may prove to be invaluable during your time at NSCC.
