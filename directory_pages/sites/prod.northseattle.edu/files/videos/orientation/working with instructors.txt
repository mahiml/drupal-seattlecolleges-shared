Working with Instructors videosNorth instructors love students and make their teaching a priority. As an instructor, I always encourage my students to go above and beyond just attending class. Here are a few tips for working with your instructors:Review your syllabus. On the first day of each class, you will receive a syllabus, which is basically a roadmap of the class that includes instructor information and expectations, course readings and assignments, and how assignments will be graded and when they are due.Ask Questions. I would always rather hear from a student with a question than find out the student didn’t understand the course material. Most instructors are available, and want, to answer your questions either during class, on the phone, or via e-mail.Locate the information on the course syllabus for how to contact your instructor outside of class hours. If they have office hours, locate the office and plan to visit during that time. Full time instructors generally keep specific office hours, and it is important to visit them in person during those hours. In online classes, you might also be able to “meet” with your instructor via online interaction, such as a virtual chat.Participate in Class. This is so important for your success! Participating in class allows you to get to know your instructor and other students, as well as gain a deeper understanding of the course material.
